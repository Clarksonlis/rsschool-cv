### About myself
At the moment I am a graduate of Minsk State Linguistic University and I want to master the profession of a Frontend Developer. After a long study, I realized that I was more interested in the IT world. I worked for a year as a SMM specialist. At work, I often had to make posters and create websites, so I am well acquainted with such platforms as Figma and Tilda. 

I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth,besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
